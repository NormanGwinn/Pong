The framework was built with Python, with tkinter for the GUI.

The tkinter code is separated from the Python code.  The game logic is encapsulated in extensible Classes:

- Game
- Court
- Ball
- Paddle
- Predictor

### To Install:

Download the Python code files and Wave audio files.

When you try to run, you might need to install additional Python libraries:

- pip install simpleaudio
- pip install tkinter
- pip install <whatever>

### To Run:

python pong.py
